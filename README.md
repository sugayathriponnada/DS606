# AI for Automated Radiology Report Generation

## Introduction
Radiologists face significant challenges due to the growing volume of medical imaging data. Analyzing chest X-ray images manually is time-consuming, prone to human error, and requires extensive expertise. AI-powered solutions can assist radiologists by automating disease detection, generating structured reports, and improving diagnostic efficiency.

To address this challenge, we propose an AI-based radiology report generation system that integrates computer vision, NLP, and deep learning to enhance radiological workflows and improve patient care. By leveraging image-text data, the system aims to:

1. Automate the generation of structured radiology reports from chest X-ray images.

2. Classify medical conditions using deep learning-based image analysis.

3. Localize abnormalities using object detection models.

4. Extract meaningful insights from radiology text reports using NLP techniques.
